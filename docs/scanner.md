# Scanner application

The scanner project is a standalone sketch that can record received timings around a specific condition.

I recommend to use a EPS8266 chip for scanning because it needs to record some 


## Wiring

The scanner project must be adjusted if you use other pins as the following:

**startPin = D5**

The D5 pin should be used with a momentary button that is pulling the signal to GND.


**receiverPin = D7**

The D7 pin is connected to the signal from the RF receiver.


**ledPin = D4**

The D4 pin is connected to the LED on the ESP-12 and is used to visualize the incomming signal. 
When using a e.g. nodeMCU alike board no wiring is requred.


## Recording

Recording is started by pressing the momentary button connected to  D5. 

A starting condition can be implemented to find a protocol candidate while recording. In the standard this condition is waiting for a long timing in the range of 6000 tp 12000 Âµsecs.

Recording then is done in the following steps:

1. First a set of timings are recorded to be sure to fill the buffer.
2. All following timings are recorded while the starting condition is evaluated.
3. When the starting condition is true the following timings are recorded until the buffer is filled.
4. Recording is stopped and all timings are sent to the Serial output to be visible in the monitor and available to be analyzed. 

## Recording example

Here is example of a recording. The last timing in the first block was the starting condition.
The first block is showing the timings before this point and the second block the timings past this point.
