# TabRF

This is a RF signal encode and decode library that can be adapted to different protocols by specifying the timing conditions ia a table. Can be used with 433 MHz receivers and senders.

10.04.2018: This library was created on AVR and ported to esp8266 boards. It is still under construction.

## TODO

* Add more protocols
* Port back to AVR.
* Use debugging output not using printf to save memory on AVR cores.
* Documentation on <https://www.mathertel.de/Arduino/TabRF.aspx>
