With the raw scanner (see scanner.md) you can collect some probes from a specific sender where you know the exact timings. I took a signal where 1:3 and 3:1 transmissions are used
and by subtracting a specific trim value from HIGH signal and adding them to LOW signal timings the exact 1:3 could be observed. You can define this optional parameter in the init  function.
